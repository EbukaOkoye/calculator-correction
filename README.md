# calculator-correction
this is a correction to the calculator project
the probmlem with the first calculator project had to do with the numbers over spilling from the calculator container
using the overflow-wrap property and setting it to break-word, i was able to control the spill. also I wrote a javascript code to display an error message when the number reaches to a certain value.
